# Matrix Calculator

------------

This was my final project of a 3rd semester subject called Math for VideoGames 2, as the name suggests is a matrix calculator that contains the next operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplications
- Simple transformation
- Composites transformation
- Matrix by vector
- Generation of new coordinates by quaternions


## Tech/Framework used

------------
This project was build with C++ and due to being for a early stage of the major it only is used as a console application.
